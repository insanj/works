youtube_title: Let's give every creature deathtouch! This is Zagras, Thief of Heartbeats. Enjoy an in-depth walk through one of my favorite new home-brewed Commander Decks. Sticking to fun retro cards and synergistic post-2020 party pieces, this is one that is easy to make and easy to play. As of the publishing of this video, each card is currently going for less than $1.00 online.
