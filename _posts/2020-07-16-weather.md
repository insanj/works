website_line_one: The goal of this test is to develop a native iOS “weather” application which shows the user’s location on an interactive map with the current weather. Users should be able to double tap on any location on the map and see the current weather based on the selected coordinates. Any free weather data provider can be used to supply the weather information (e.g. OpenWeatherMap API).
