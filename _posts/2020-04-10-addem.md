website_line_one: now defunct social webapp made for ❄️ rochesterians. give your points friends! for what? hmm... that's a good question. a scalable social network built from scratch in React, Node.js, Heroku, PostgreSQL, integrated with a Discord bot and lots of niche features. became a daily open for our friend group during the beginning of the pandemic.
