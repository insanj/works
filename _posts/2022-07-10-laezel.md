youtube_title: What if I told you-- For every counter you make, you get to make ANOTHER ONE, again and again? Welcome to the wacky Lae'zel, Guild Artisan deck, and welcome to the 2nd walkthrough in my regular series on the Commander format. Lae'zel is a white counter-multiplying commander paired with Guild Artisan, a red Treasure-producing background. Enjoy a detailed step by step analysis of the underlying strategy and inner synergies of all 100 cards. Background music is all original, self-composed, and unique to this episode.
