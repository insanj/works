	  <li class="list-group-item">🍏 PeerPal DevOps tool. PeerPal was acquired by Graduway near the end of 2021. This was a side-project that turned into a powerful internal devops tool. Using Electron and vanilla JS, Pal is a super simple app to build and develop for, and uses Docker to do the heavy lifting. Create "Review Apps" based on the ScopeDevs projects-Select a branch for each project, then watch as Pal clones the repos, networks them together using Docker Compose, and exposes them remotely using an ngrok tunnel to a randomized local port. Ta-da! 🎉 </li>
